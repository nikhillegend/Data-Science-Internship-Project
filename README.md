ðŸ“ˆ Stock Market Forecasting

This project focuses on predicting stock prices using historical data and time-series forecasting models. The dataset (NestlÃ© India stock data) was sourced from Yahoo Finance and analyzed through EDA, daily return calculations, and visualizations with Plotly. Multiple models were tested, including Exponential Smoothing and Prophet, with an Auto Ensemble Forecaster delivering the best accuracy (lowest RMSE). Finally, the model was deployed using Streamlit, allowing real-time stock forecasting via a web app.
ðŸ”¹ Tech Stack: Python, Pandas, NumPy, Plotly, Statsmodels, fbProphet, Streamlit 

ðŸ“‘ Resume Classification (NLP Project)

An NLP-based project that automates resume screening for recruiters. The model extracts and classifies key details such as skills, work experience, education, and certifications, helping HR professionals reduce manual effort in candidate evaluation. Various ML algorithms were tested â€” Random Forest, SVM, Naive Bayes, Decision Tree, and KNN â€” with Random Forest achieving the highest accuracy (95.8% on test data). The system was deployed with Streamlit for interactive classification.
ðŸ”¹ Tech Stack: Python, NLP, Scikit-learn, WordCloud, Streamlit 

ðŸ“š Book Recommendation System

A machine learning recommendation engine built using the Book-Crossing dataset. The system suggests books to users based on popularity and collaborative filtering. Implementations include:

Popularity-based recommendation using weighted average ratings

Collaborative filtering with cosine similarity & Surprise library models (SVD, NMF)
The model generates personalized book recommendations and was deployed via Streamlit for real-time user interaction.
ðŸ”¹ Tech Stack: Python, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Surprise Library, Streamlit
